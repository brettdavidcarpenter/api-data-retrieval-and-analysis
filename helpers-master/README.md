Scripts for commercial data work

The match request iterator is a script to call the match API to retrieve data from the data store. Currently, it takes a csv and outputs to a csv, though this should be improved to support a format agnostic output.

A similar version of this script exists for the risk characteristic specific work. This version is meant to mimic the output of the S3 flags script that was created by the data analyst team.
